I am currently a student a Cerritos College and have been since 2018 I am part of Student Accessibility Services (SAS) program. In 2003 I was was involve in a car accident which left me permanently disabled in a wheelchair. When I was younger school was difficult for me I was always distracted and found it hard to stay focused so eventually I droped out and started to work. After my accident and having a second chance at life I decided not to waste it and finish my education. Now am just trying to live my life and achive something that would improve my life style. </p>
